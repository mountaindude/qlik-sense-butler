# Running Butler

The easiest way of starting Butler is by using the normal node.js way of starting node apps:

    d:
    cd \node\butler\src
    node butler.js

It is of course also possible to put those commands in a .bat file and execute that file instead.  

## Process monitors
As Butler is the kind of server that (probably) should always be running on a server, it makes sense using a node.js process monitor to keep it alive.  
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) and [Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) are two process monitors that both have been successfully tested with Butler.  

One caveat with these is that it is hard to start them (and thus Butler) at server boot. It's easy to auto-executing the process monitor when a user logs into the server, but having the requirement that you log into the server immediately after server boot is of course less than ideal.  
Options for solving this issue are currently being evaluated and tested.
