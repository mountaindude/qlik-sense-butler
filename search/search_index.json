            "text": "Requirements\n\n\nButler depends on various pieces of software. Some are required, others are optional, as described below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSense Enterprise\n\n\nButler is developed with Sense Enterprise in mind. While many Butler features might also work with Sense Desktop, you are on your own there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMQTT broker\n\n\nMQTT is used for both in- and out-bound pub-sub messaging. Butler assumes a working MQTT broker is available, the IP of which is defined in the Butler config file. Mosquitto is a nice open source broker. It requires very little hardware to run, even the smallest (free!) Amazon EC2 instance is enough, if you want a dedicated MQTT server. If you don't care about the pubsub features of Butler, you obviously don't need a MQTT broker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnode.js\n\n\nButler is written in Node - which is thus a firm requirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows or OSX\n\n\nWhile Sense is a Windows only system, Butler should be able to run on any OS where node.js is available.\n\nButler has been succesfully used - both during development and production use - on Windows, Linux (Debian and Ubuntu tested) and OSX.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nBelow are the general steps needed to install Butler. Please note that you might need to adapt these to your particular system configuration.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall node.js\n\n  Butler has been developed and tested using the 64 bit version of \nnode.js\n 4.4.6.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide where to install Butler\n\n  It is usually a good starting point to run Butler on the Sense server. If there are more than one server in the Sense cluster, Butler can be placed on the reload server (as the /createDir endpoint then can be used to create folders in which QVD and other files can be stored).\n  That said, it is quite possible to run Butler on any server, as long as there is network connectivity to the Sense server(s).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Butler\n\n  Download the repository zip file or clone the Butler repository using your git tool of choice. Both options achieve the same thing, i.e. a directory such as d:\\node\\butler, which is then Butler's root directory.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall node dependencies\n\n  From a Windows command prompt (assuming Butler was installed to d:\\node\\butler):  \n\n\nd:\ncd \\node\\butler\\src\nnpm install\n\n\n\nThis will download and install all node.js modules used by Butler.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMQTT message broker\n\nMany of Butler's features use \nMQTT\n for sending and receiving messages.\n\nMQTT is a standardised messaging protocol, and it should be possible to use \nany broker following the MQTT standard\n.  \n\nButler has been developed and tested using \nMosquitto\n running on OSX and Debian Linux - both work flawlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation dependencies\n\n  If you plan to modify or extend Butler's documentation, you will need to install \nMkDocs\n.\n\n  MkDocs is used to create the pages you are reading right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity considerations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should make sure to configure the firewall of the server where Buter is running, so it only accepts connections from the desired clients/IP addresses.\nA reasonable first approach would be to configure the firewall to only allow calls from localhost. That way calls to Butler can only be made from the server where Butler itself is running.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of right now the MQTT connections are not secured by certificates or passwords.\nFor use within a controlled network that might be fine, but nonetheless something to keep in mind. Adding certificate based authentication (which MQTT supports) would solve this.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nButler uses various node.js modules from \nnpm\n. If concerned about security, you should review these dependencies and decide whether there are issues in them or not.\n\nSame thing with Butler itself - while efforts have been made to make Butler secure, you need to decide for yourself whether the level of security is enough for your use case.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nButler is continuously checked for security vulnerabilities by using \nSnyk\n, with status badges shown in the readme files.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nButler uses configuration files in YAML format. The config files are stored in the src\\config folder. Prior to v2.1 JSON config files were used, but as YAML is much more human readable than JSON, a switch was made.

What  Comment      Sense Enterprise  Butler is developed with Sense Enterprise in mind. While many Butler features might also work with Sense Desktop, you are on your own there.    MQTT broker  MQTT is used for both in- and out-bound pub-sub messaging. Butler assumes a working MQTT broker is available, the IP of which is defined in the Butler config file. Mosquitto is a nice open source broker. It requires very little hardware to run, even the smallest (free!) Amazon EC2 instance is enough, if you want a dedicated MQTT server. If you don't care about the pubsub features of Butler, you obviously don't need a MQTT broker.    node.js  Butler is written in Node - which is thus a firm requirement.",

Install node.js \n  Butler has been developed and tested using the 64 bit version of  node.js  4.4.6.       Decide where to install Butler \n  It is usually a good starting point to run Butler on the Sense server. If there are more than one server in the Sense cluster, Butler can be placed on the reload server (as the /createDir endpoint then can be used to create folders in which QVD and other files can be stored).\n  That said, it is quite possible to run Butler on any server, as long as there is network connectivity to the Sense server(s).      Download Butler \n  Download the repository zip file or clone the Butler repository using your git tool of choice. Both options achieve the same thing, i.e. a directory such as d:\\node\\butler, which is then Butler's root directory.      Install node dependencies \n  From a Windows command prompt (assuming Butler was installed to d:\\node\\butler):    d:\ncd \\node\\butler\\src\nnpm install  This will download and install all node.js modules used by Butler.      MQTT message broker \nMany of Butler's features use  MQTT  for sending and receiving messages. \nMQTT is a standardised messaging protocol, and it should be possible to use  any broker following the MQTT standard .   \nButler has been developed and tested using  Mosquitto  running on OSX and Debian Linux - both work flawlessly.

As of right now the MQTT connections are not secured by certificates or passwords.\nFor use within a controlled network that might be fine, but nonetheless something to keep in mind. Adding certificate based authentication (which MQTT supports) would solve this.      Butler uses various node.js modules from  npm . If concerned about security, you should review these dependencies and decide whether there are issues in them or not. \nSame thing with Butler itself - while efforts have been made to make Butler secure, you need to decide for yourself whether the level of security is enough for your use case.

Send messages to platforms such as Node-RED. Node-RED is an open source platform (with a graphical editor) intended for integrating different systems and data sources. As it is built on node.red there are many different modules available, offering integrations with all sorts of systems and protocols. \nUsing Node.RED together with Qlik Sense and Butler, it is possible to interface with social media from the Sense load script (send a Tweet when some condition occur during app reload, for example).",
